## Major Changes
 There have been no major changes to the project; timeline is still the same, and
 project specs in the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FP9NxLKu0oAbKUnAQtEWmshNW047A-YwUBGoOy_lv50/edit) are still being followed.
 as shown below: <br>


## Accomplishments These Two Weeks
I've built a complete skeleton app that allows two users to chat with each other. Users have their
own account, and can view gifs of each other's gestures. Chatting a specific text has a pop-up that
will soon be replaced with gesture detection. Right now, the app uses FireBase's authentication and
database storage for messages.

## Meeting My Milestone
I am on track to meet my milestone! The design students in charge of gestures are a bit behind, but
instead I will be working on researching the full range of motion that I can detect with the phone.

## Looking Ahead
I'll be refining the baseline code that I have, and will start to flesh out the gestures and how
they'll be detected. I also plan to set aside some time to write full specifications of the database
and flow of intents in the Android app.

There are no major surprises or extra resources needed at this time. I'm looking forward to making more progress on the project!
